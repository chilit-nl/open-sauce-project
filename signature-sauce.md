# CHILIT Signature Sauce

The CHILIT Signature Sauce is a complex, and tasty sauce that has something of everything: Smokiness from the paprika powder and the liquid smoke, umami from the miso paste, sweetness from the onions and the maple syrup and a small hint of acidity from the passion fruit. It is perfect with some typical Dutch deep-fried fingerfood!
